The Way it Works at Work
So you are now, what {age} years old, right? You think you know how it works in the {occupation} world
just remember these few tips:
When you greet a coworker in the breakroom say, "Hey, working hard or {adverb} working?" This shows them you are " The {nickname} ."
Make friends with the cleaning staff, they always know where the {object_plural} are.
Be nice to your boss. Kiss {body_part} to stay on her good side.
If your boss ever asks you to guess her age, REMEMBER:
If she looks {old_term} , shave off {large_number} from your original guess and pray she doesn't {verb} you.
If she looks young, repeat the same step as before.
Lastly, if ever asked to stay overtime and work overtime without getting overtime because it's "volunteer work",
never say, " {angry_phrase} " instead say, " {nice_phrase} "
Good luck,
Love {annoying_person}
xoxo
